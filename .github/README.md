[Original NewPipe Readme](../README.md)

## About this fork
Due to restrictive project policy, the NewPipeTeam refuses to add platforms that they
find offensive. This fork (BraveNewPipe) will not be as restrictive. As long as the
platforms work in the spirit of free speech, they could be integrated.

Nevertheless, platforms that promote pornography or other degrading things will
__NOT__ be included here.

## Contribute
This fork will focus only on integrating other platforms. Unrelated patches will
be rejected for now.

Feel free to suggest which alternative platforms should be included. Any contribution
(development/testing/bug report) is greatly appreciated.

## Which additional platforms are supported?
- Bitchute
- Rumble

## Other features not found in NewPipe
- merged NewPipe x Sponsorblock into this fork. [NewPipe x Sponsorblock Readme](../README.md)
- searchfilters: in the action menu of the search page you can now change
  the search behavior for the actual search. The supported content/sort
  filters depend on the service. More information [PR TeamNewPipe#8837](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/8837)

## Reporting bugs
Most problems with BraveNewPipe should be reported to the NewPipeExtractor
project, as platform support is developed there.
